# Intro to Data Science Project

Description

## Dataset

[Yelp Data](https://metatext.io/datasets/yelp-open-dataset)

## DONE (may need to be adjusted)

- Read input data into dataframe (including reconciling different json files)
- Parse data (esp. text data), including stop word removal, stemming, lemmatization
- Identify common words (Tfidf vectorization) 

## TODO

- Construct word clouds (and tables) (by topic)
- Word2Vec model
- Topic clustering (LDA)
- Logistic Regression model / Linear Regression model (on review score)
- Comparison with other classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM)
- Come up with and implement ways to visualize results
- Design website / interface

## Possible Extensions

- Manually scrape Yelp data, to involve more data wrangling and tailor what types of data to analyze
- Look at tip data
