# Intro to Data Science Project

Description

## Dataset

[Yelp Data](https://metatext.io/datasets/yelp-open-dataset)

## DONE (may need to be adjusted)

- Read input data into dataframe (including reconciling different json files)
- Parse data (esp. text data), including stop word removal, stemming, lemmatization
- Identify common words (Tfidf vectorization) 
- Topic clustering (LDA) 

## In Progress

- Construct word clouds (and tables) (by topic) **(ARI)**

## TODO

- Word2Vec model (Not sure we need this)
- Logistic Regression model / Linear Regression model (on review score)
- Comparison with other classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM) (Not sure about this either)
- Come up with and implement ways to visualize results
- Design website / interface

## Possible Extensions

- Manually scrape Yelp data, to involve more data wrangling and tailor what types of data to analyze
- Look at tip data
