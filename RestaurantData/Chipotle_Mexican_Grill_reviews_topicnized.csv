Every time I come in, there's this energetic woman that helps me with the first part of my order.  Totally off topic, but her voice kind of sounds like Rebel Wilson's and I find it really endearing.  Anyway, she's great, and she helped me again today, making sure I had fresh veggies instead of the ones that had been out for awhile.  When I got to the register it was a young lady with a massive amount of hair tied back in a bun (she gave me her name but I don't remember) and she was with another young gentleman, and they were both very pleasant.  I was fumbling around in my purse and realized I had forgot my debit card at home, and didn't have cash.  I was really embarrassed and felt bad, and after telling the girl at the register my mistake I turned to go...  Now this is why I went through the trouble of downloading this app, making a profile, and writing this review.  Instead of making it awkward, or just letting me continue on my way, she very sweetly and enthusiastically stopped me from leaving and offered for me to still have my order.  It's not just what they did (the guy was in on it too) but the way they made me feel so good about it.  It really made my day.  She said that if I wanted to leave a review that would be more than worth it, and I thought that was a great way to pay back the kindness.

27,1,2,0,3,0,"This Chipotle has become one of those places where the employees give intentionally poor service (especially as the evening goes on) in the hopes that you will go away. Funny, since Gusto! is basically next door & even has a sign out front that says ""OUR CHIPOTLE IS BETTER,"" bc they have a bowl option that is incredibly similar. And their format is similar. Only it IS infinitely better, as is the service, & cleanliness. (It just costs more.) So I ended up here at 10 til close after never getting waited on at Tomatillos in East Atlanta, not intentionally showing up somewhere at the last minute. I came here bc I was starving and trying to save the $ I should've spent on Gusto! instead. I walked in & asked for a burrito bowl for here. (I always finish in under 10 minutes, as I did tonight.) The girl promptly listed off a BUNCH of ingredients they were ""out of"" (read: they decided to stop ""making"" it for the night; no way whoever does inventory didn't have all that stocked in the store to basically heat up & dump in a vat), in a tone that clearly conveyed her hope it would encourage me to turn around and exit in frustrated side-eyeing disappointment, rather than have her go through the effort of scooping ingredients into a bowl one more time (for, you know, her income/employment). I told her I was starving so I looked at what was left and figured out a way to still make myself a satisfying burrito bowl, albeit sans two of my usual ingredients (or lettuce - the ""out of"" included brown rice, corn, lettuce, and I think some meat option(s)). She looked disappointed but obliged, although she oddly had me repeat my choices of black beans and chicken. Then the cashier, instead of saying, ""Anything else?"" or ""Anything to drink?"" said, avoiding eye contact (chatting with the security guard), ""That's all?"" and started to tell me my total. So I had to say no and tell her what juice I wanted. Then she said, ""That's all?"" and rung me up, again with no eye contact. I went to sit and quickly eat my food, and the tops of almost every interior table were filthy. Which maybe explained why all but one customer was eating on the patio? I was going to photograph all of the nastiness, but just as I sat, the cashier started cleaning up - in order to leave sooner. At 5 minutes til close, she was loudly announcing to the security guard, in the dining area in the presence of me & another customer, to lock the door ""at 10. Not 10:01, not 10:02. TEN."" Yeah. I've worked at Starbucks and other such jobs. This is not how you are being paid to behave with or around customers. So I guess they'll enjoy their search for new employment soon when they succeed at stopping their customers from returning, and pushing us all over to Gusto!, where they will definitely never be hired. Oh - second star is only because the food was fine, the price is fine, parking lot, and I assume their health score was probably okay, but I could be wrong there.

34,8,3,2,1,1,"Yes, this Chipotle has long lines, but I've seen longer lines at Chipotle locations towards the OTP suburbs.  Poncey-Highland Chipotle is located along a very busy stretch of Ponce, next door to Friends on Ponce, and across the street from Green's and Murder Kroger.  The clientele at this Chipotle is often young, hip, and urban.

The parking lot is small.  The restaurant acknowledges this with signs that say, words to the effect of: ""Our burritos are big, but our parking lot is small.""  It's not uncommon to see a panhandler directing traffic in the parking lot and asking for money later.  If you can't find parking, I suggest parallel parking along Maiden Ln. behind the restaurant.  I don't know how strict Friends and other neighboring businesses are with towing Chipotle customers, so be careful.

Compared to other locations, this Chipotle is relatively small.  It does have a nice enclosed and elevated patio which is a prime spot for people watching (traffic watching?) on Ponce.

I've generally found the food and service to be good, which is consistent with other locations.  Chipotle takes pride in its naturally raised meats, organic vegetables, and sustainable building practices.  Tastewise, I can't tell a significant difference between a burrito at Chipotle and a burrito at Moe's or Willy's -- they all taste good to me -- but it doesn't hurt to know that you're eating better stuff at Chipotle.

Burritos, burrito bowls, tacos, and salads range in price from $6.25 to $6.65 per order depending on the meat selection.  Meats include chicken, steak, carnitas, and barbacoa.  Cilantro-lime rice, black beans, pinto beans, salsa, cheese, sour cream, and other toppings are included.  Guacamole is $1.80 extra.  I'm a fan of the rice.

Like other burrito joints, Chipotle has a made-to-order, line ordering format.  You control what goes into your burrito from the very beginning.  The open kitchen is located behind the ordering counter, so you can see all the meats and other ingredients being prepared and cooked fresh.  During peak times, it's possible for the ordering line to run out of certain ingredients when it's your turn to order.

One of my favorite items to get is the burrito bowl because it's simple, tasty, and relatively healthy.  It's also easy to transport on-the-go.  I like to get chicken or steak.  All of the meats aren't bad.  The chicken is surprisingly tender.  I usually load my burrito bowls with all available toppings, particularly corn salsa and spicy salsa (in addition to the standard pico de gallo).  The spicy salsa is indeed spicy.  If that's not enough, hot sauce is available.

Drinks, condiments, and silverware are self-serve.  Satisfactory service.

I hadn't ever set foot in a Chipotle until late last year in NYC.  It didn't appeal to me on any level. I don't eat fast food. I don't like the mention of McDonald's within 500 feet of my person.

Despite not having tried it, I found it easy to mock the people going in there, to sneer at the faux-Mexican food, and to insist that it never enter my intestines, no matter who vouched for it.

My ever-awesome boyfriend had a sit down with me.  He looked me straight in the eye [I only have one] and said, ""just try it.  If you don't like it, I'll never, ever mention it again.""  He wasn't arguing for its culinary superiority or authenticity, just that it's flavorful, usually fresh, cheap, and most importantly, reliable.

17 barbacoa tacos, 5 black bean burritos and a chicken burrito bowl later, I couldn't agree more.

No, it's not real Mexican.  But it's damn tasty.  Food doesn't necessarily have to be authentic to a particular remote region of the world to taste good. There's lots of variations in between.  If you want real Mexican or real Latin food, I would never suggest coming here. There's really no point in making those comparisons. There's a grand distinction between pretty fresh fast food and a slow cooked, authentic sit down dinner. Apples and oranges, man.

Never lack of flavor in any of their ingredients, raw industrial motif, and completely fair prices is what keeps my respects for Chipotle steep and is what has me constantly returning.
As for the customer service its an easy 3 stars. I have been to multiple Chipotle's throughout the U.S including Texas, Kentucky, Florida, and now Georgia and the employes have either been decent or completely horrible. Very disappointing for, in my opinion, their almost flawless establishment. 
Very glad to see that they have always acquired their liquor license, its always great to grab a beer or margarita with Mexican food.

The staff there has the most horrendous attitudes. Talking while there are customers WAITING . The location is always unkept and not properly stocked. The food isn't properly handled.

Today I stopped to pick up a burrito bowl. This location clearly prefers to hire teenagers to work behind the counter . They are not very professional.  As I tell the  2nd young lady  who puts on the salsa etc what I would like we come to the corn salsa which is clearly low. I request two scoops as Inalways do, she barely gave me 1 scoop and said with with a smart tone that's all there is. That's it . I looked at her and asked I would like more. She just looked at me . I please pack up my order it seems you have an attitude. She rolled her eyes and laughed. 

As I go to the checkout to pay I see a card but it wasn't for the owner of the location so I asked the young lady ringing me up for the information. She says she didn't know but the supervisor was there . A guy comes over states he is the supervisor and his name is Don. 
I asked for the locations owner /manager. He says what is the problem. I state I would prefer to speak with the owner/manager. He stays he isn't ABLE  to give me the information. I restate what he has told me and then I say if he is refusing to give me said persons contact information, I will contact Corporate. Don states I guess you will need to do that.

I take my food, I go over to the counter with napkins cutlery to put in my bag as I'm. STILL in the location. (By the way it is terribly unkept or stocked. This isn't my 1st time seeing this at this location) I HEAR and see the Supervisor Don , the young lady in question and another employee cooking the good discussing the incident in front of other customers and in the food line area. I state on my way out, you should've waited until  I left the store before discussing it and furthermore you should not be discussing it on the FLOOR in front of other customers because it is Unprofessional!

They were out of chorizo. Doordash called and explained, so my response was ""no problem, how about steak?""

Chipotle manager: ""steak is 50 cents more and the order was prepaid, so can't do.""

For more background, chorizo is 55 cents more than a standard meat option and steak is 1.05 more. Most reasonable people at this point would have just put steak in the bowl.

Ok, fine - seems a bit ridiculous, but fine. How about chicken... how about no meat at all (that was the only option I was given as an alternative even though I paid extra for a premium option that they were out of and never updated on the app - not even a downgrade to a standard option).

93,67,3,2,0,1,"Prior to the Midtown location opening, this used to be my Chipotle location of choice. It has all the usual fixings you'd expect at a Chipotle, but let's break it down:

PARKING: World's smallest parking lot. It will be a challenge to find a spot during primetime hours but I've always managed to find one eventually. There's also street parking available right behind the restaurant on one of the side streets, so it's not too terrible to drive here.

FOOD: My experience here with the food is usually pretty good, definitely what you'd expect from a Chipotle. No complaints about the quality or taste.

ATMOSPHERE: Again, pretty typical for Chipotle. More space inside than you'd think based on the size of the parking lot. It's also usually pretty clean in here in the dining area, and the condiments station is typically well-stocked and I've never had to hunt down a plastic fork or napkins from the cashier.

SERVICE: This is where I dropped my rating a couple stars. Having worked at a quick service restaurant for almost 6 years, I have a pretty solid understanding of how they should be run. This location is always hit or miss. For example, tonight's experience -- one of the younger employees had his AirPods in while working the food line this evening. As you'd expect, this did not go well since he's required to hear what a customer is saying as part of his job. While he was putting my burrito together I asked for ""regular steak"" (instead of the new carne asada) and then watched as he piled my tortilla high with chicken. I then told him I asked for steak and he said, ""No, you said chicken."" I corrected him and said, ""No, I asked for regular steak."" Without saying another word, he smirked and remade my burrito. Annoying, but whatever. Then... I hate sour cream, so I don't ever get it on my burritos. Unfortunately, there was a huge mess of sour cream globbed onto the food counter. While Air Pod Kid was wrapping my burrito, he pushed one end of the shell all up in this nasty mess of sour cream just sitting on the counter. Thankfully, another employee saw what he was doing and made him wrap it with different aluminum foil (since that, too, was covered in sour cream). I was reluctant to ask them to remake my burrito a THIRD time, so now I'm stuck with a burrito I don't really want because it's a mess of old ingredients I don't enjoy.

By the time we left, Air Pod Kid had taken the pods out of his ears, presumably because the experiment of working with them in was a disaster for me and it was obvious to his fellow staff members. Not super psyched that I was the guinea pig for that experiment, nor should a kid that arrogant and lazy be customer-facing.

Will I let it stop be from coming back to this location? Probably not. Chipotle is Chipotle. This location just needs to up its standards for staffing, especially because the one in Midtown has an AWESOME, super friendly staff that puts this location to shame.",Chipotle Mexican Grill,Atlanta,GA,30306,33.773927,-84.363565,227,1,"Restaurants, Fast Food, Mexican",1,False,True,True,True,False,False,'casual',True,"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'classy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}",True,True,True,2019,"prior midtown locat open , use chipotl locat choic . usual fix 'd expect chipotl , let 's break : park : world 's smallest park lot . challeng find spot primetim hour 've alway manag find one eventu .

I heard the manager, who was sitting with some corporate big wigs, to tell the crowd something and then we were told that our meal was comped due to waiting.  I think it was not the manager's idea to do this and was more forced by his company at the table.

104,3,2,1,1,0,"I come to this Chipotle often, but the last few times I've visited, the service and quality have been quite sub-par, today's being the worst. When I arrived at approximately 5:20PM there were only a few people in the place so I expected that the attentiveness and quality would have been better. I ordered a burrito to go with half brown rice and half white rice with steak & sofritas with a side of chips. The portions of rice and meat I received were stingy and made me frown. I was haphazardly handed off to another employee to proceeded to be equally stingy with cheese and salsa. The burrito was then wrapped so poorly that it fell apart before I had a chance to unwrap it (by peeling the foil off of one end while keeping the rest of it wrapped like you're supposed to). I discovered that the rice was undercooked and grainy, the steak was overcooked, and the sofritas were cold (Note I only live a block away). To really drive the nail in the coffin on my meal, the chips were all stale. Now, I used to be a kitchen manager for Chipotle before I moved here from Ohio, so I know what the consistency and quality SHOULD be.

Yes this is a chain, but at least I know what to expect. It is a fast, cheap, and safe gluten free dining option. A pretty hard combination to find at times, especially after working late at the office and not wanting to stray far from the hotel for a meal.

The design of this location is pretty good from others that I have seen in my travels. I do like how they a sectioned off the line and created a separated queue from the seating area. The seating area itself has a decent amount of tables.

As for the food, it is the standard fare. The taste of some of the ingredients seems to taste a bit off from what I am used to in other locations of the US. The steak and rice tends to seem a bit bland at times. 

The workers are good about changing their gloves when I alert them of my gluten allergy. They do have a process of changing out the line spoons, which seems to be a Portland protocol as I haven't seen this done anywhere else in my travels.

156,3,2,2,0,0,"I regularly eat food from Chipotle and I love the food. At least one or twice a week I come in to order food or order online, so I have visited many restaurant locations. This is by far the WORST quality location I have yet to go to. 

I have been to this location at least 30+ times over the past year. Every time I come in the staff has been rude and they either take forever to make your food or rush you through the line rolling their eyes if you ask for anything more then what they give you. Other staff quickly apologized for their colleagues attitudes and frequently will offer ""free"" drinks/chips/guac to make up for other employees mistakes. Don't even get me started on the arguments and personal life drama conversations that happen. Where is management when they need it? No one knows.

I have never been to this location and been satisfied with a burrito. 90% of the time they are out of at least one or two ingredients because they have not been made and then you have to wait 15mins if you want them, making other customers wait longer in line. 50% of the time the rice you get has not been mixed well and you end up with a mouth full of salt. Additionally the guac is almost always brown and the queso is cold. My online orders have been wrong every time- you would think it would be simpler looking off a online order form to make a bowl. 

To wrap it up, tonight I stood in a line for over 25mins that in any other location would have taken less then 10mins. Also forget being sanitary- the staff filling up the food trays wasn't wearing gloves after stating mins before that he was going to the restroom. I even found a hair in my food tonight.

They are always backed up on orders so never expect your pick up order to be ready anywhere near on time. Especially around dinner time. I don't know why this particular chipotle is always so behind when others seem to manage this system just fine. My most recent visit consisted of standing around with 10+ other customers waiting on pick up orders... 

I know they get slammed and are moving as fast as they can, but this is not a one off experience and they really need to re-evaluate how they can make this process roll more smoothly. Perhaps the app should not suggest a pick up time that the restaurant cannot meet. I just want a clearer expectation of how long I might be waiting. 

The food, however, is pretty on par with typical chipotle so at least there's that. Though last time we had it delivered from this store, our order was no where near correct.

I used to devour huge burritos but have persuaded myself that I can save the 300+ calories by forgoing the tortilla, so in recent times I've chosen the burrito bowls. Quite fresh ingredients, especially considering that this joint is still part of a fast food chain. My go-to protein is the barbacoa, which is wonderfully seasoned shredded beef.

They had two new guys (I guess?) working.  The ""rice and beans"" guy was scraping the bottom of the rice pan when I walked up and asked for a burrito bowl.  He lifted the steamer machine thingy and started to put the paper bowl in, then realized what he was doing.  Instead of getting a new pan of rice, he managed to scrape up about 1 and 1/4 spoons of rice and squish it in the bottom of my bowl.  Then, ""rice and beans"" guy said ""Beans?"", and I said, ""Yeah...black beans"" to which he reached into the vat of frijoles goodness and got one meager scoop of beans laden with ""juice"" and plopped it on top of the rice.

(mind you, by this time a seasoned employee had replaced the rice with a fresh batch and taken over rice station; I kept hoping ""rice and beans"" guy would put the bowl down and let someone else take over my bowl's assembly so that I might get a little more rice and bean goodness, minus the bean juice...but I digress).

By this time, ""rice and beans"" guy was giving me the tour of the ""meat station"".  I asked for chicken, and you guessed it, times are tough I guess so I got about half a spoon full of ""pollo"".  ""Rice and beans"" guy stopped at protein station, and his friend (who apparently was also new) at ""toppings"" station took over my predicament bowl, I MEAN burrito bowl.

""Toppings"" guy asked what I wanted (yeah...) and I said ""Green tomatillo please"", to which he dropped the spoon and pulled out, oh, about an ounce of salsa (SCHERIOUSLY?), then a big ol' helping of sour cream, and a mountain of cheese.

Lately though, I've noticed that with new staff, the service behind the counter has gotten so much worse than with previous employees. I don't know if they underwent a management change or what but the service really makes us unhappy and dread coming back when we want a delicious burrito.

First of all, the SCRIMPING. Oh my god you have to beg them to put some damn rice in your bowl. My husband asked twice for more rice and still wasn't happy with the half-scoops he was given. I have to ask for at least two scoops of almost everything because they refuse to give you a normal amount of food. Chipotle isn't cheap. Give me some damn food.

Then there is the cleanliness issue. They do get very, very busy; but if they know that, hire someone full time to maintain the restaurant. Food on every table and don't even get me started on the floors. So gross.

If it wasn't for the consistent food taste and quality we'd just go to Willy's every time (although I cringe using that as a comparison bc they are completely different). But the truth is, when we don't feel like dealing with the hassle of this chipotle, we go to Willy's.

250,35,1,0,0,0,"I have never written a review before, but am a very frequent diner at Chipotle, and today's experience was the final straw. I, and many people I know, love the food but we all constantly complain about the service. I definitely think it is certain locations, and this Dunwoody one is the WORST. I asked for a bowl today and wanted brown rice, but the woman making the bowl said they didn't have any. I asked her ""are they just making it, or you don't have any at all?"" She said ""We only have white rice."" I said ""Are you sure?"" She said ""Yes."" They make my bowl. As I am about to pay, they bring brown rice out.

Excuse me? You just told me you didn't have any brown rice. As in....at all. And do not tell me there is a language barrier. You understood what I said. I told the lady who was closing up the bowl, and she had them make me one with brown rice. Ok fine. But whoever the manager or owner is at this location, you must understand that this makes your entire operation look terrible. This is not the first time it has happened either. There is always something. Either they give you 3 pieces of meat, or sigh if you ask for one shred more lettuce. Most of them look like they hate being there, and that somehow, it's your fault. I am a huge customer service advocate, and this is honestly one of the worst places to go if you are looking for a pleasant experience.

There are many other restaurants that serve the same food. You need to realize your customers have that choice. Unfortunately, I will likely be choosing Willy's or Barberitos or even the Chipotle on Roswell Road in the future...I just cannot stand the service at this place. At Willy's they ask you how you're doing, they smile, they give you normal servings....they are more than amenable to the customer. They have just as long of a line and just as much pressure to keep it moving. But they are always a pleasure. Barberitos is not as overly friendly but they don't look like they want to strangle you at least, and their servings are pretty decent as well.

279,64,1,1,1,0,"This is the Chipotle location that turned me against the entire chain.  I will never visit another Chipotle because of my experiences at this one.

This location seems to employ the stupidest people in the entire Atlanta Metro.  Not only are they hard of hearing, they also don't understand clear, concise and simple English.

The vast majority of the stupidity lies in the person ""in the middle"" that handles the salsa, cheese and other toppings.  I have never in my life had so much difficulty getting through to a set of human beings in my life.  The first person usually gets it all right, which type of rice and beans.  Simple enough.  The cashier doesn't usually make too many errors, although on a number of occasions, they were unable to understand what, ""I have double chicken,"" actually meant.  So, I made off with a little discount.  It was comical to see the shrugs from the other patrons in line so as to say, "" They can't understand you, just take the free chicken.""

The ultimate gripe here is that the pico de gallo is frequently on the ripe/rotten side and the chicken quality is trash.  Seriously, as disgusting as Pollo Tropical is in Georgia (versus Florida) their food is still five times better than this slop.

When sending my complaint to the corporate office over the rotten smell of the pico de gallo, I receive the defiant response from the store (via the corporate office) that the pico de gallo was freshly made just two hours prior.  Yeah right.  Was it left out in the open for those two hours?  Fresh tomatoes and onions do not develop a rotten smell in just two hours if stored properly.  Food safety is not a joke.

323,39,2,2,2,2,"I stepped on the scale this morning and lost three pounds. You know what that means? I am compelled to sabotage it with a trip to an eatery where I can order up 1,000 calories in one meal. I'm talking about big-hunking burritos. I'm talking Chipotle.

I am normally not a fan of Chipotle. Of all the big-hunking burrito chains, this one ranks pretty low on my list already for several reasons I won't get into here. But mainly, they just do not offer a big enough variety for my taste.

However, as it turns out today I was running an errand at the Arbor Walk and decided to buy my lunch at this Chipotle location. I figured since I ran 4 miles this morning and was heading to the office for who knows how long on a friggin Sunday, I should get something substantial to tide me over until my dinner of, most likely, beer while laying on the couch watching the Olympics. (Honestly, I really think I'm going to keep off that three pounds...)

When I walked in, the girl was staring off into space and someone had to point me out to her. After reading other reviews, this seems pretty normal at this location. I asked for the small size burrito while indicating the size with my hands cupped in half-moon shapes connected at the fingertips (same as the international symbol for ""may I have a small side of ranch dressing""). The lady behind the counter and I went a couple of rounds of ""we don't have smaller"" and I thought she couldn't hear me because the music was so G.D. loud in there, and then I realized I am thinking of the Freebird's option (they have multiple sizes). So I was fine with their size. Not a big deal.

She asked me if I wanted beans and rice. I said black beans, no rice. So she pulls out the tortilla and I see her scoop up the rice and I said ""no rice please, just beans."" She evidently did not hear me from the loud-ass music they're playing in there as if to mask the fact that their service is lax, so I raised my voice and said ""NO RICE!"" My loudness and the context of what I said made me stop and think how ridiculous this place is. 

I went down the line and chose my fillers. She asked me if I wanted guacamole and mumbled something. I said, ""yes, but what did you say?"" She said there is an extra charge, thinking it's probably like 50 cents or something small. I said that's fine. At the cash register, the guy who'd pointed me out to the space cadet earlier rang up my total of $9.09. WTF? For a burrito and a soda? I found out that dollop of guacamole cost $1.50!!! I was like, ""This place is ignorant!"" I know, I know - I was the one paying for it, but I walked out thinking that I could buy an avocado for less and mash it up and put it in the burrito myself. A dollar fifty for guacamole is highway robbery if you ask me. Does your guacamole make me poo gold, Chipotle? I guess we'll have to wait and see. 

I am giving them an extra star because of their little story on the side of the soda cup about Wes Jackson and his revolutionary achievements in agriculture.

327,43,4,0,0,0,"Sometimes it's hard to beat a big, tasty burrito.  I don't know who came up with the concept of the modern burrito, with rice, beans, cheese, specialty meats, and all the extra fixin's - but obviously, that person was a genius.

Since Chipotle burritos are custom made to your specs, let me give you my recommendation on the #1 best burrito that can be made from the ingredients Chipotle offers.  Here's what you tell the gal behind the counter (and yes, 19 times out of 20, it will be a gal, and she will be a recent immigrant.  Chipotle is kind of old school in this regard.)

-Burrito
-Rice
-Pinto Beans (for God's sake, trust me here, and deny that pesky black bean urge that you have.)
-Barbacoa (that's the Mexican style shredded bbq beef)
-Pico
-Sour Cream
-Cheese (you may have to ask for a touch extra)
Lettuce
Done!  That means no corn salsa, or any of that other silly junk.  

There you go.  That's a 100% Jonathan W. Approved and Guaranteed burrito, developed through years of experimentation.  Deviate from this formula at your own risk.

My take on the Chipotle concept:
-----------------------------------------------
Chipotle, as you know, is a chain, at one time affiliated with the dreaded McDonald's Corp., who has since divested its financial interest.   So if you hate McDonald's, rest assured that not one cent of Chipotle's profits go to the evil corporation.

Now, despite the fact that Chipotle is a chain, and that there are other specialty burrito chains, namely Freebirds and Q-doba, I feel that Chipotle offers a fairly unique product.  And they do so with remarkable consistency from location to location.  So, for better or worse, if you've been to one Chipotle - you've been to them all.

335,4,4,2,0,4,"I'm happy to admit that I prefer my Mex in the style of Tex.  Since we're a far cry from the Lone Star State (Guero's & a Shiner Bock anyone?), and a further cry from the Pacific Time Zone where I first sampled Chipotle, I was beside myself with joy when I saw they were opening in Medford.  (Why Medford?  I got nothing against the Medfordese, but it just seems like an odd location to launch a franchise).  After moving back to Boston and having my friends rhapsodize about Anna's, I had resigned myself to the fact that my friends sucked.  White American Cheese product?  Anyway, I should save this tirade for a review of Annas.  We're here to discuss the sublime deliciousness that is Chipotle.  

Ahh, fresh cheese, all the ingredients in front of me, and, can you believe it?  Hot sauce that's actually HOT.  

I'm a creature of habit, and usually scarf down the fajita burrito.  I like not having beans forced upon me, but I do like the black bean option, in case I'm lacking fiber.

It's a party in there.  All the different tastes coming together, the cool sour cream, the spicy chicken.  I hope they open more of them in the area, so I don't have brave that crazy route 16/28/38/I-93 neighborhood anymore.

It's a lot of food, but you get what you pay for.  If I'm going to shell out 6 bucks for a burrito, I want it to fill me up.  All day.  Also, they've got three kinds of Tabasco sauce out in the open, waiting there, saying, ""go ahead, make it even better!'  If you go with a friend be sure to try the guac. 

My one complaint, is that there are no additional japalenos to stick upon your creation.

First time I went here, there were 3 people working.

I don't know if they're all smoking dope or if the GM is just incredibly shitty at hiring.

I went back a 2nd time because I figured if the employees weren't all fired by now then the place wouldn't even still be open. I got in line with 4 people in front of me at a standstill, they were out of rice. We waited 10 minutes for the rice to come out as the line grew to ~15. I asked for white rice and it felt like I was in a soup kitchen. The rations were tiny because they now had to make orders for these 15 people. I then asked for pinto beans in which he loaded on black beans. I bit my tongue even as he then proceeded to add pinto beans. My jaw dropped at the incapacity to perform a simple task.

After a harrowing trail run in the Middlesex Fells reservation Saturday afternoon my boyfriend suggested ""Let's try that burrito place you read about on Yelp that you want to try. Isn't it up here somewhere?""

Me, ""Yes, it's in Medford but I don't know where exactly. I drove past it once. It might be route 16? I'll call and ask them where they are."" After paying far too much money to call Dir. Assistance from a cell phone, I reach Chipotle:

Attempt 1: 
Chipotle worker: ""Thank you for calling Chipotle""
Me: ""Hi, can you please tell me where you are located?""
Chipotle worker: ""Please hold.""
Me: Patiently waited on hold for several minutes only to realize they disconnected me.

So, now we are now driving down 93 and I know that we're close to the exit where I think it is so I don't want to give up. I call again (after having to be reconnected by the Dir. Assistance operator).

Attempt 2: 
Same Chipotle worker(based on distinctive accent) : ""Thank you for calling Chipotle"" 
Me: ""Hi, can you please tell me where you are located? We just got disconnected.""
Chipotle worker: ""Please hold.""
Me: Waited on hold (a little less patiently) for several minutes only to realize they disconnected me again!

Okay, now I'm getting pissed! My boyfriend called the next time because I was too mad to deal with it. And now, on principal we had to find the damn place.  

Attempt 3: 
Same Chipotle worker (based on distinctive accent): ""Thank you for calling Chipotle""
My boyfriend: ""Hi, I need to know where you are located?""
Chipotle worker: ""Please hold.""
My boyfriend: ""No, don't put me on hold. I just need to know your address and you have hung up on us twice.""
Chipotle worker: ""Please hold."" 
My boyfriend: ""I just need your address.""
Chipotle worker: Finally, she asks someone in the background for the address and comes on the phone and says ""Fellsway"" and hangs up.

We are now aggravated beyond belief. So, my boyfriend while driving looks to his left and wouldn't you know...there was Chipotle. After all that, we found it on our own anyway.

So, we went in and the line was approx. 30 people deep, and I am not exaggerating. It might have moved fast but we didn't wait to find out. We were so put off by the whole phone experience and now this line. So, we walked next door to Boston Market.

I asked to speak to the manager to sort this all out and he went back to ""speak,"" to him/her for 5 seconds but no one came out with him... I waited for about 15 minutes on the side and still no one came out. I ended up just asking for my receipt and he said ""I don't know what to do."" All in all, I paid $30 for two chicken bowls and chips. Never coming back again.

First time I went here, there were 3 people working.

I don't know if they're all smoking dope or if the GM is just incredibly shitty at hiring.

I went back a 2nd time because I figured if the employees weren't all fired by now then the place wouldn't even still be open. I got in line with 4 people in front of me at a standstill, they were out of rice. We waited 10 minutes for the rice to come out as the line grew to ~15. I asked for white rice and it felt like I was in a soup kitchen. The rations were tiny because they now had to make orders for these 15 people. I then asked for pinto beans in which he loaded on black beans. I bit my tongue even as he then proceeded to add pinto beans. My jaw dropped at the incapacity to perform a simple task. I got to the register and asked for chips. To cap off the experience, they had no chips.

411,10,1,0,0,0,"2017 update: Sadly, this location has not improved at all in the last two years. Serving sizes are not consistent. Today, I ordered a bowl for pick up, got home and found that it didn't even fill up half of the bowl which everyone knows is not normal. The flavor and quality of the food is getting significantly worse. The only plus side is the current employees are friendly and they finally fixed the giant pot hole in the parking lot. The only lesson I've learned from eating at this location is to order on the app and pick up in store because long lines are the norm at this store. 

----

This location is often one of the worst Chipotle's I've been to. Granted, I live in the area, so it's the most convenient to get to so sometimes I hope to god that the next experience will be better than the last. It hardly ever is. They're VERY slow and considering there's only about five places for people to get lunch in the area, you'd think they'd be a bit faster. The food quality isn't completely terrible - when chicken still looks and tastes like chicken, I can't complain too much. 

HOWEVER, what I can complain about is the sanitation issues this location has. Firstly, this location always has very dirty work stations. The employees are not careful about keeping the worktop clear of food. But the worst part is that they contaminate food because of their lack of sanitation. 

My roommate is vegan - chipotle is one of the few vegan/vegetarian friendly ""fast food"" places and one of the ONLY vegan friendly restaurants in New Albany. Every single time we go to this location, there is cheese in the guacamole. Granted, it's corporate's fault for thinking that it's a good idea to put cheese right next to guac, but the employees here truly must not care about accidentally mixing cheese into their vegan guacamole. The last few times my roommage and I have eaten at this location, he skipped the guac altogether because he can't trust it anymore. This is sad because when you get veggies, you get free guac and he LOVES Chipotle's guac. 

But the ending point is that this location is dirty. You can't trust this location to have a clean workstation and you can't trust that there isn't cheese in the guacamole - vegans beware.",Chipotle Mexican Grill,New Albany,OH,43054,40.09356367,-82.8235461923,89,1,"Fast Food, Mexican, Restaurants",1,False,False,True,True,,True,u'casual',True,"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}",True,True,True,2017,"2017 updat : sadli , locat improv last two year . serv size consist . today , order bowl pick , got home found n't even fill half bowl everyon know normal . flavor qualiti food get significantli wors . plu side current employe friendli final fix giant pot hole park lot . lesson 've learn eat locat order app pick store long line norm store . -- -- locat often one worst chipotl 's 've . grant , live area , 's conveni get sometim hope god next experi better last . hardli ever .

Been to this location probably a dozen times, and it's my least favorite Chipotle. Bros always want to give you like 4 grains of rice and a slice of chicken. If you ask for more rice they always act like it's coming out of their personal rice supply that is feeding their starving Grandmother or something. C'mon, I'm getting a vegetarian bowl with no beans, hook me up with an extra tablespoon.

Besides that they're kind of rude. Guy tonight kept making ""hurry up"" gestures with his hands and saying ""keep going"" while I was in the middle if naming an ingredient. Weird. There were like 3 people in line.

Medford gave you the lead, Watertown you were supposed to be my anchor. You could have taken that lead and swam with it, instead you sunk. 

The staff was very friendly, so kudos there, guys. The perfect 'rito - it all begins with rice. It's like the soft down pillow for my head of chicken. This pillow was missing some feathers. I'm just saying, the 'le never disappointed before on the pillow and this one was like a beaten down, flat wisp where wonderful fluff once was. I'm not a bean man, so none of that. On to the head of chicken, or lack thereof. I just want a spoonful, not a lot to ask for. What I got was the shimmy. Yup, guys, the scoop and shake leaving me licking my lips wishing for more. Not double chicken, I don't want a Siamese twin, just a fully formed head not one that looks like a hammer cracked it.Next those wonderful toppings, the sheets of the 'rito.

I'm not saying I Rain Manned it but I'm talking like 11 shreds. I had to ask for more! At least they don't charge me extra for that. Don't do it, 'le. Just don't don't. It'd break my heart. What about the comforter you might ask? That tasty, warm tortilla. It had a HOLE, in it. Letting all the heat escape, letting my 'rito collapse. Not cool, guys.

I am from the area of this chipotle in the arsenal mall and I have to say I am so horrified and disappointed when I go there. The one in alewife is on of my favorites by far. My most recent visit to the arsenal chipotle was one of the worst. Where to begin... I stood there waiting as I was the only person up at the counter, I watched the employees argue with each other while one girl was eating the chips out of a bowl with her bare hands. Finally I was greeted by a young man who never looked at me once because he was too busy death starring everyone around and behind me as if they were all guilty of something. I began to order my food and was given such tiny amounts of rice and toppings but a disgustingly huge amount of meat. While he was making my food a girl employee was standing next to him and gossiping about other employees while she snacked on all the food with her bare hands! Literally she was grabbing handfuls of cheese and picking at pieces of chicken right off the line, next to my bowl! I then ordered some guacamole to have on top and completely regretted it after he put it on the bowl, it was all brown- food quality issue! I was disappointed as chipotle is always fresh!i then watched as all the employees in the back were picking at all kinds of food as it was being prepared to be brought out, again no gloves. I honesty don't want to see people eating the food I'm eating with their bare hands dipping in and out of the containers as well as chewing with their mouths open as a customer is right there. I then paid after I was given the total Ina co platelet demanding way, he seemed so irritated to be ringing me up,I gave him my credit card which then pissed him off more because I didn't have cash to tip him. I was so polite the entire time it was almost like I was on a hidden camera tv show seeing how I would react to all this... I said ""thank you so much, have a great day"" and was replied with ""yup"" he rolled his eyes and walked away.

After visiting the Winter Park location twice, it is absolutely evident to me that Floridians are also OBSESSED with Chipotle and more locations need to be built in the Orlando area. It is simply not prudent to leave your office at 11:50, go to Chipotle, wait on line for 25-35 minutes, and not get back to the office until 1:25 PM.

A googlemaps search shows that there are NINE Chipotles in the Orlando metro area. Jeez, maybe you guys need a Q-Doba or four, or something. But seriously, things need to get sped up here, either by another area franchise or by efficiency training (which I don't think can help, they move pretty fast here) or I won't be able to go back.

Also the parking sucks ass. There's like 7 spots, otherwise you need to park on this random side street or in an office park which clearly tells you not to park there.

The food was just as good as any other Chipotle in the United States.

And did someone complain about lack of drinks? Seriously? Try going to 99% of fast food chain places, where all you have is Pepsi, 7-Up, Dew, Barqs and some acidic-carbonated lemonade.

Nobody was behind me in line, and nobody was working the toppings station, so once he was done with his part, he just left my burrito there to wait.  Way to not go the extra mile, dude.  So my burrito and I waited for the next person to return to her station.  Once there, she added the toppings I asked for, but seemed annoyed when I asked her to mix my burrito innards up...because most people want a full on globby bite of guacamole, isn't that why we pay extra?  So she grabbed a fork, mushed the guac blob around like a child that doesn't want to eat their veggies, and was done...so there was that.  I kinda laughed and she got even more annoyed, so she half folded my burrito (don't they have burrito folding degrees here?)...then didn't even completely wrap my burrito with the foil and laid it on the counter to be invaded by whatever germs have jumped on the counter from the passing of payment.  Awesome.  Nobody was at the register, so I grabbed a bag in an effort to beat the 5 second rule by bagging my own food, when I realized the bag only had 1 handle.  Huh?  I finally got to one with 2 handles when the cashier returned to the counter (from sweeping the floors, full on grabbing the dust pan and everything) and reached for my food to bag it for me.  I quickly said, I got it, you've been sweeping!  He got the idea and went to wash his hands and another lady completed ringing me up.  This was the grossest visit I've ever had at Chipotle, but I'm giving it 3 stars because I did maul that burrito and guacamole, so I feel like the cooks in the back deserve 3 stars for taste.  

Hopefully, Chipotle will get back to the on point-ness that I once loved them for, but it seems like morale could use a boost here, and maybe a refresher in cleanliness....??",Chipotle Mexican Grill,Winter Park,FL,32789,28.593647,-81.36532,97,1,"Restaurants, Mexican, Fast Food",1,False,True,True,True,False,True,'casual',True,"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}",True,True,True,2016,", thought good time big chipotl scare , may thought soon . went winter park chipotl greet guy seem distract . nobodi behind line , nobodi work top station , done part , left burrito wait . way go extra mile , dude . burrito wait next person return station . , ad top ask , seem annoy ask mix burrito innard ... peopl want full globbi bite guacamol , n't pay extra ? grab fork , mush guac blob around like child n't want eat veggi , done ... . kinda laugh got even annoy , half fold burrito ( n't burrito fold degre ? ) ... n't even complet wrap burrito foil laid counter invad whatev germ jump counter pass payment . awesom . nobodi regist , grab bag effort beat 5 second rule bag food , realiz bag 1 handl . huh ? final got one 2 handl cashier return counter ( sweep floor , full grab dust pan everyth ) reach food bag . quickli said , got , 've sweep ! got idea went wash hand anoth ladi complet ring . grossest visit 've ever chipotl , 'm give 3 star maul burrito guacamol , feel like cook back deserv 3 star tast . hope , chipotl get back point- love , seem like moral could use boost , mayb refresh cleanli .... ? ?",True,'no',u'average',u'beer_and_wine','yes_free',"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}",True,,,0.6151545789539554,0.0011775130067165985,0.0706437053053507,0.3118379380028714,0.0011862647311059098

As we moved along the station to select items it was clear that the food was becoming dry and needed to be attended to. We turned to take a seat and all the tabletops were dirty. I asked the man at the register if I could have a rag to wash off a table and he happily came and wiped off one table and returned to the register. There weren't any new customers at this point. I looked around and the dining room was totally filthy with food and other items on the floor, dirty seats, empty napkin holders, and a sticky floor near the soda machine. I asked a woman on break if the manager was in. She got her for me. I said to her, ""Look around this place. What do you see? This place is filthy! With all the health complaints with Chipotle lately, I would think you would care about this."" I've never done this before in my 64 years of life but I truly was aghast. She said she was dealing with an employee problem and that she took total responsibility. Meanwhile she did not direct her staff to wash tables or sweep the floor. She eventually walked out herself and refilled the napkin holder. The woman taking her break heard me talking to my husband and asked the guy at the register to wash some tables and sweep. He tried, but was clueless about how to clean a table, wipe down the benches, or sweep properly. It was obvious that staff training in this restaurant is poor. Not one staff member saw it as there responsibility to clean up during downtime. I love the food, but it makes me uncomfortable about the quality of preparation when the dining room itself is so filthy and the management is not doing its job by giving direction or making sure staff is properly trained.

628,8,1,2,3,0,"Finally had the time to write this review so here I go. Let me preface everything I'm about to say by emphasizing the fact that I used to frequent this location quite a lot. I live by Millenia and it's filled with franchises, so I've always opted for Chipotle seeing as it's not so terrible for you. 

However, after the absolutely horrible experience I had this weekend, I can confidently say I will NEVER return to any of the locations...ever. On Saturday, I ordered a veggie bowl to go and took it home. Mid-bowl, I chewed on something really strange. As I retrieved it from my mouth, I noticed it looked an awful lot like a fingernail. I have 10 fingers, each with a nail and I cut them frequently, so I know what they look like. Still, I double checked before making a decision. I got a second opinion from my mom who was with me and she was horrified when she saw it. I then took it upon myself to compare it to an uncooked grain of whole wheat rice to see if maybe that was what it was. It definitely had no resemblance, and after conducting this analysis, I came to the sound conclusion that it was indeed a fingernail. 

Ok. So next step, call the restaurant and let them know the inconvenience you've encountered in the hopes they will help...right? Wrong. When I called, the manager came on the phone and immediately seemed annoyed with me as if I was the one who had just served him a fingernail fiesta for dinner. He first said he would give me my money back, and began to look my order up in the system. He asked what I got and I answered - a veggie bowl with chips and guac. He responded with, ""okay so it was about 7 something?"" I said it was about 11. He then, in an aggravated manner, told me guac wasn't included in a veggie bowl to which I answered, ""yes, but I got extra guac."" He was acting as if I was trying to get a free meal which was already annoying me. Like dude, I just got a fingernail in my food. I'm not some weirdo who goes around claiming I have fingernails in my food for free rides. 

ANYWAY...he then said it was impossible that it was a fingernail because all of his employees have to wear gloves....as if no employee ever in the history of food service has ever broken protocol. Nice try. 

At this point, he doesn't even want to return my money back and asks that I come show him the fingernail. I cannot lie...I am AGGRAVATED at this point but after a much heated conversation, I say alright...if you're really looking for a scandal. I was so so upset by this that in my frantic preparation to go, I lost the damn fingernail. I looked for the fingernail on my hands and knees with a flashlight for 15 minutes, understanding how entirely ridiculous the situation was. As my mom laughed through my fingernail search, tears came down my face as I yelled in frustration, ""IT'S NOT FUNNY!"" It kind of was. I can now see the humor in the situation, but was definitely not happy at all as it was occurring.

I gave up, ultimately realizing I wasn't going to find it, but was so upset by the situation, I felt I needed to write this very long review to address the lack of professionalism on the manager's part. Regardless of whether the finger nail was there or not (it was), you never deal with a customer in the way that I was dealt with, especially given the situation. I am now grossed out by both the food here and the manager.

Not wanting to unbuckle the kid only to find out that the restaurant had already closed, I rolled down window and asked two employees sitting in outside dining area of the restaurant if they had already closed. They both looked at me, then at each other, and rolled their eyes. 
2) They ""ran out"" of guac. I buy only veggie bowls so the guac is my ""meat"". It comes with that type of bowl. I still had to pay full price for my bowl. Oh well.., it still tasted ok. 
3) Certain employees are very stingy with the ingredients. I mean.., I know it is an approximation and an art form.., but come on! They act like it's money from their retirement fund or something. Tiny little pile of three-corns in the middle of the bowl. My veggie bowl should be a VEGGIE bowl! That IS the focus!
4) Out of guac again.

Well, it seems that the designers of this location were sold on this idea in full. Certainly, this location could not have been designed with regular cars in mind as there are probably a total 10 parking spots available. This makes for a very frustrating time trying to get your burrito fix. 

When it comes to the food, this location has usually been excellent for me. One of the most inconsistent food items available are fajitas and coincidentally, these are my favorite part of my bowl. The short north location often has mushy or burnt fajitas, but that's not the case here. The steak has also been consistently free of fatty bits, something that sloppier locations tend to ignore. So in a nutshell, excellent food here.

Even when I go during off hours at like 3:45pm and I can get a parking spot, there are still other major issues. Why can't I just grab my own online order? Waiting and staring at it while the cashier keeps ringing up other people is frustrating. Besides that, they don't seem to be able to keep promise times. The other day I saw about 10 people standing outside? 

The last straw for me today was ordering a sofritas bowl that was filled with chicken and steak. Not just one piece, but MULTIPLE! I am not a vegetarian but I was still unsure what I was even actually eating. The bowl was overfilled too and soggy on the bottom.

663,26,2,4,3,2,"""How can someone possibly give a Chipotle two stars?!"" you might ask. This specific location on 5th Ave in Grandview has two major issues:

1) Parking - The parking lot is tiny and narrow, which makes it difficult to navigate. Especially with cars pulling in and out constantly. 

2) The service - The employees here are usually unfriendly and very slow. This causes a ridiculously long line to form - usually from at least the cash register to the door and sometimes winding among the tables as well. They also are often out of ingredients (usually the fajita vegetables), which causes additional slowdown as people wait for the food to be cooked.

One tip to avoid the line - order online! From my experience, they seem to prioritize online orders over the people who are ordering in the store.

All that being said, the food itself tastes the same as any other Chipotle.
