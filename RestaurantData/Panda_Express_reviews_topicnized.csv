28,28,1,0,0,0,"Hate to do this, but what a disappointment. Hard pass on this Panda Express location. We definitely won't be back. And this is from people who normally love Panda Express. We frequent other Panda Express locations quite a bit. In fact, Panda Express is one of my kids' favorite meals when we grab fast food -- so we know our dishes and what they and the portions should be. This one isn't a drive thru location but we had errands in that part of town and hadn't yet eaten. Fine, so let's go down. That being said, you would have thought the customer service would have been better given the person to person interaction. Wrong.

We normally get a Kid's meal for my Little, half beef broccoli half orange chicken, with split fried rice and chow mein. The lady behind the counter said we couldn't do half and half. What? Okay fine, we don't like to make waves. So I ended up getting an adult meal for my small in size seven year old so she could get the meats she wanted -- she doesn't even finish the kid meal so what a waste. I watched the lady pour the kids meal into an adult container and resignedly put in our two half meat choices.

We ordered a total of three adult meals to go -- and you could literally right before your eyes see how stingy the lady was being on portions. Not two scoops of rice, but one and a half. It was almost like watching her perform a mental calculation of how little can I put it in here and still make it passable (barely). She was actually pouring food out of the scooper so she wouldn't put too ""much."" My thought was, wow. But what are you going to say? Put more food in the container, please?

Sure enough, come home with our three adult meals and there's very little food. Now, it's Panda Express and cheap so I don't expect five courses or a buffet or overflowing plates. But this was meager. And tight. And unpleasant all around. Very lacking in what we are used to from other locations. As much as I normally like Panda Express, I felt ripped off with this experience. And really, how hard is it to give half and half on the meats? Not like we'd be getting more food -- clearly.

Food quality was about the same as other locations. The service -- just plain bad.

The Orange Chicken is super classic to this place, it's delicious, but it's also very strong in flavor. I recommend sampling it before you order it, just in case. The Honey Sesame Chicken Breast was even better, though. The honey and the sesame flavor were present, but more subdued. I could have eaten a gallon of this stuff. 

I got the fried rice, it was exactly what you're picturing. I also got the orange chicken. I got the Grilled Teriyaki Chicken (adding the optional sauce on top), and wow it was delicious. It didn't taste like fried chicken tossed in sauce. It tasted grilled and tender. Solid. But the best thing I had this visit was the Beijing Beef. The grilled beef had a solid crust on the outside of each strip and it was tender and delicious. The peppers and onions it was mixed in with paired perfectly with it. 

The food was as expected, superb. I really enjoyed the service on this particular visit. I asked the gentleman at the counter what he recommended in terms of the entrees, and he started throwing free sample after free sample at me and my girlfriend. He was so nice, and I got to pinpoint exactly what I wanted.

59,6,2,1,1,1,"First the pros: Fast, clean & inviting. 
Unfortunately, the pros are not enough to convince me the food is worth writing home about. 
Gripes abound. ""Grrr"". 
For starters I was very amused (in an unpleasant way) to see the cooks weighing and measuring everything about to be dumped in a large vat, er wok, of hot oil (which appears to be the only cooking method available). While I am not against a business making money, I am against large chains reminding me that I am about to plunk down my hard earned money during hard times so that the corporate big wigs can still earn their more than comfortable salaries. 
OK, so no big deal - as long as my food is good. I do not mind paying my fair share of dough for some good eating - but for this crap I have a problem with. For starters, I estimate that about 75% of the weigh of my food is starch (rice, chow mein). And if that wasn't bad enough, the little bit of protein served is dry! And not just the protein, but rather all the amenities therein too! I suspect this is due to the fact that this establishment still shells out food a la McDonald's of yesteryear, meaning they prepare their food in bulk and store it in a metal hotel pan over a hot water bath until a customer is ready to be served. That's cool and all if it's constantly busy, but it's not cool during down times when there is only a few customers (which is the time I was in).

I love authentic Asian food and am usually quite adventurous, but sometimes, one just needs an Americanized version of Asian food - not too spicy. Panda Express generally delivers reasonably uniform quality regardless of the location. I was not disappointed. The honey-chicken and Beijing beef were the typical fair, although less spicy than I have eaten in other Panda Expresses. Given the meeting, no complaints about the less spice.

The staff was very nice and offered tastes of items. My representative was a good sales person as he offered me several upgrades at minor charges from appetizers to an extra meat. As I am a sales and marketing professional, this salesmanship simply made me smile. He was not pushy about the offers either - just informative and enthusiastic.

Otherwise, there were warming trays of Chinese food offerings. I felt like I was straddling two different realities.  Is it fresh or is the wok guy a shill?

It is Asian American.  Not as spicy as I like nor as Asian as I like but it will do since they have the packets of hot mustard and I'm already here. The Cashew Chicken was free (thanks to a coupon) and for a little over $3.00 I added an egg roll (meh) and fried rice (another meh) and a water.

So, the food.  Well, the orange chicken and rice were the exact cheap Chinese food that I sometimes crave.  But the eggroll that I waited so long for?   It was hot on the outside but the vegetables inside tasted barely cooked at all.

To be honest, I wasn't impressed.  I believe that they'll cook you a fresh dish if you ask, but I didn't.  So, instead I just chose from whatever meager, dried-out portions remained in the chafing dishes. 

The taste was about what you'd expect from a Chinese buffet.  But the food was lukewarm at best.  Luckily I have a strong stomach as eating chicken that's been sitting around for awhile could've been bad.  My dad, of course, was eating happily away.  Being the polite daughter that I am, I pretended to enjoy it.  Who am I to criticize a free meal?   

In retrospect, I think it had to do with the entrees I chose.  I like mixed meat and vegetable dishes, not the typical americanized fare.  You know, General Tso's or anything else that consists of huge chunks of deep-fried meat.  But since that stuff seems to be more popular it's understandable that the cooks would continuously be setting out fresh, hot portions.

The two star rating is entirely for the drive-through service and not for anything else.

1) First time I went there, my husbands two-entrée meal was incorrect. Ok, fine, maybe I was unclear on the speaker as the ticket reflected what they'd given us.

2) Second time I went there, both my meal and my husband's meals were incorrect. They were correct on the ticket. I filled out a corporate feedback form, and they sent us a pair of free meals. That does make me feel better.

3) Third time I go there with free meals. Aaaaand, they mess up my husbands order. It was correct on the ticket and, once again, boxed up incorrectly. This time I had the sense to check the order before driving off, so the error was corrected.

I don't know if it is these 2 employees' problem or this Panda Express does this on purpose. Anyway, avoid this Panda Express, horrible employee, no standard. A new BS was born here!

Do restaurants like this even want customers? You hear about these places suffering and you go to support and get crappy services.

This guy was also going between the front door and the food prep area making food to put together orders, why? He needs to just pick up orders already prepared not back and forth like that.

We get to the front of the restaurant and there is like 4 people waiting we ordered 45 mins prior but the way they have it setup looks like your cutting the line not a fan of that either. 

I told my wife I refuse to go back there.

281,19,3,2,0,0,"""Oh bliss. Mall food.""

That above quote was from an old episode of ""Buffy"" in which she eats Americanized Chinese food at a mall. I would assume it is Panda Express. Anyways, Panda Express is your typical mall food, served really fast and the food is right in front of your face. The lines in here are usually long. I have only visited three Panda Expresses, one at the Waterford Lakes Shopping Center in Orlando, FL, the one in Universal Citywalk Orlando, and then the branch at the Riviera food court in Las Vegas. 

The Waterford location is at a mall near UCF and lines are usually long during lunch.  I usually get the orange chicken and broccoli beef with the half and half rice and lo mein, and sometimes the eggrolls.   The food is mall food, but it is considerably better than the other choices. Usually one meal is both my lunch and dinner, since they give you huge portions. On most of my visits the food is newly cooked and the chicken is crunchy. However there are times in which the chicken is kind of old. 

When you think Vegas, you usually think buffet, but I was really hungry and decided to try the Panda Express at the Riviera. The line was longer than a theme park ride (no exaggerating!) and the good thing about it is the food is constantly fresh and newly cooked. I ordered the same items and I was not disappointed. However for some odd reason I felt hungry after that and ate at the Slots O' Fun restaurant (where they have 75 cent footlongs) and was so full of food, I can barely move! 

The CityWalk branch is open really late.  It's a joint that drunks like to stop by and pig out like after several hurricanes and other liquors nothing beats Americanized Chinese.

Overall, Panda Express is a decent restaurant.

I usually order the plate and have them put one of the entrees in a box before I get to the  cashier. It stops me from eating too much most of the time. Great place to go when you are really hungry. The salt and sugar are probally pretty high in their food. So really can't go there too often.

Prices are a bit high when the family goes with me (that is why they lose a star). Not a big fan of Pepsi products and they do have those. So I stiick with the tea or water.

This location is very understaffed. Upon walking in, we were welcomed to a long line that reached to the front door. We got in line around 8:25PM and did not reach the front of the line until 8:50PM. I do not blame the workers at all for being slow. This place really needs more people. I almost feel bad for the workers because they are on their feet constantly. The line didn't die down while we were there. 

As far as food goes, there isn't much to say about Americanized Chinese food. The food is average, but isn't as fresh as I would like, which all leads to back to the location being poorly staffed... 

In addition, the cashier who rang me up forgot to give me a receipt. They clearly have a sign that says if they forget to give you your receipt, the meal is free. I realized I didn't get a receipt a few seconds after sitting down. When I went back to the cashier, I mentioned he didn't give me a receipt, and simply gave me the receipt he intended to give me. I looked at him and said that the sign said the meal is on them... he looked at me confused and said ""what?"" I pointed at the sign on the register and he turned it around, read it, paused for a few seconds... and said ""oh we can take care of that!"" He was very friendly and I appreciated his customer service.

They hand me the containers that had been sitting there the whole time and I leave. Imagine my surprise when I see that only one order had an entree; THREE were missing. There goes my money and my dinner.

At least when ordering thru the line you first choose between brown or white steam rice or fried rice or chow mein noodles or steamed veggies.  That's the largest portion of the meal. I tend to order half steamed veggies and half of which ever of the others strikes me.

Next there are about a dozen different preparations of chicken or beef and occasionally there will be one or two shimp choices. Some are listed as spicy  but are minimally so. There are usually a couple with dried Chinese chilies .

Today those were even mild.

Typically food is fast. Today however there was no one in the kitchen when we first got there. I tried ordering the crispy shrimp and was told they cooked it to order.... first time in 10 or more years I heard of that.
Got the rest of our food, paid for it,all inclusive of the shrimp and finally asked when I would get it.

They had forgotten the order. So they immediately cooked it and also paid me back it's cost!

326,21,2,0,0,0,"My family and I stopped by at 8pm for a late dinner. As we approached the doors we saw a customer exit her minivan as she waited just past the exit of the drive thru, yelling at the employee delivering another order to a car. The customer was complaining how she was told it'd be at least 5 minutes just for some sauce. That should have been my first clue at what our experience was going to be.

I joked with my family that if what they wanted wasn't in the bowl then choose something else. After all, we all know this location is famous for being out of everything. Sure enough, this trip didn't disappoint. Of the entire selection they were out of TEN items; empty bowls with no display of hustle refill them. Even the orange chicken only had enough for two portions. One lonely egg roll sat alone in the bowl looking dry as a brick. Even more confusing was the single spring roll. How can you have one single spring roll when they're sold two to an order?

We ordered what we could, substituting what we wanted with what was available. The employee accidentally dropped his Huntington pen into the bowl of teriyaki chicken and then pulled it out with his bare hands as if it wasn't a big deal and placed it in his pocket. I can only imagine what kind of cooties lived on that pen as it's the same one customers use to sign when they use their charges/debit card, let alone what else the guy had in his pocket.

To wrap things up we were asked if we wanted fortune cookies. I guess these are now considered extras instead of being part of the meal. As we ate we continued to watch order after order for the drive thru being delivered to cars waiting in the parking lot.

I usually like Panda Express.  I went to this location for the very first time Thursday night and was met by the Kid. You know the type.  Thoroughly unhappy that he's working there. Wished he had his phone in hand to check his texts or emails.

I ordered a 3-entree meal - in particular, Panda Express' current special - spare ribs. The Kid told me - and I quote - ""We have to make those special. It'll take 15 minutes. Next time, why don't you try ordering online?""

Well, I was starving, so I told him I didn't mind waiting 15 minutes.  I looked at their selection and noticed that almost every entree pan was empty.  I asked the Kid, ""Do you have any vegetables?""

No response. He's looking away, looking irritated.

""Excuse me?"" I repeat. ""Any vegetables?""

Finally he looks at me and says, ""Do you see any?""

""No, that's why I asked you if you have any.""

I get this huff, this sound as if I've asked him to make something from scratch.

""Whatever we have here,"" he replies.

When I checked out, the young lady there gave me a free drink because I had to wait for the ribs.  My other 2 entrees (shrimp with walnut, mushroom chicken) were fine, but the white rice was crunchy from being dry and overcooked.

15 minutes later, she brought over a plate of ribs - cold. Where they came from, I don't know. Why were they cold?

353,19,2,6,5,1,"Panda Express has reopened after recovering from a bad case of short bus soccer mom driving Suburban from passenger seat. It was raining,  and this Circle C genius thought it prudent to edge the 'burb a few feet closer so the person she sent in for to go wouldn't get a couple more raindrops.  Well,  she succeeded in putting the 'burb through the plate glass window and inside the week-old restaurant, which then was shuttered with Plywood for a few weeks.

I'd been so anxious and hopeful that this place would have reasonable Asian food because it's so much closer to my house.  Understand that I saved my PE virginity for this store, so they held it in their hands to impress or depress.

The layout::
After figuring out that this was basically a reverse buffet (or Asian Luby's) I ordered fried rice, orange chicken, and kung pao chicken with a side of cheese rangoons and a small fountain drink.  Total damage was $9.31 with TT&L.  I thought that a bit expensive relative to regular buffets where the amount of food is not predetermined and you're not locked into just the two entrees you picked.

The food:
Food is served on undersized paper plates that are then filled heaping high so you think you're getting a lot of food.  What you get mostly is the side order, in my case, fried rice.  The entree portions are reasonable, and some couples might find that a two-portion entree can be shared, which would make for a cheap meal.

The taste of the food left a lot to be desired.  The best of the lot was the orange chicken, but it should be as this is one of their signature entrees.  I was impressed by the quality of the chicken in both dishes; I didn't taste any dark meat, stringy meat, or bones.

The kung pao chicken was well prepared, and I was very impressed with the vegetables that were included.  However, the flavor was rather blase.  

The fried rice I also found to be fairly flavorless.  I was longing for a packet or two of soy sauce to improve the flavor and raise my blood pressure.

The rangoons were OK, but just OK, and I wouldn't add them again.

The service.
There is no service after the cash register.  I even had to beg for napkins; I was issued three.  The tables are barren of even so much as a salt shaker. Chinese gets messy with all the sauces, and it took exactly three napkins to make it through the meal.  The staff is typical fast food; they could seemingly care less about your experience.

The atmosphere:
There are tables and trash cans and you.  You're expected to pick up after yourself when you leave.  It was quiet because there are few customers at the time I went there (around 5 PM on a Saturday).

Other Notes:
One thing I did note about Panda Express that is an issue for many is that they use no MSG in the preparation of their dishes.  Perhaps that's why the flavor was lacking and why I don't feel hyped or dropped after eating there.  I feel normal.

Summary:
All through the meal, I felt like I was cheating on my favorite Asian, Firebowl Cafe.  The food was almost as expensive and it wasn't nearly as good.

I can see why his jaw hit the floor. I never thought i would say that the best chiinese food I've ever had came out of a chain drive thru.... but here I am. Their cream cheese rangoons are TO DIE FOR.  They even rival the crab and cream cheese rangoons I used to get as a child from a little shop in my home town (which i still rave about to this day). The food came out promptly, and was hot and delicious.... they are very generous with the rice... no way anyone could finish that. So if you're thinking about getting 2 sides of rice.... 1 will probably do just fine.

Response to response:  The answer is 'w, x, y, and z products contain no animal products but are still prepared in a shared kitchen' to cover cross-contamination claims.  The fact is, though, that the animal products (chicken base) were removed from the products to make them suitable for plant-based persons.  So when someone comes to the counter and asks if you have changed the recipes to the new vegan-friendly options, your response should be ""YES, W, X, Y, AND Z MENU ITEMS ARE FREE OF ANIMAL PRODUCTS BUT ARE STILL PREPARED IN A SHARED KITCHEN.""
