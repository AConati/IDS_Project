The sandwich itself is decent, fish was fried well, enough sauce, lots of lettuce, I prefer it to the filet-o-fish. 

For the onion rings, they didn't drain the oil so it soaked through the box, through all the napkins, through the bag, and onto the table at home, which required me to find more napkins to clean it up, pretty unappetizing.

13,13,3,2,1,1,"I've only been here once, but it's very unlikely that I'll return.  Why?  Because there is a freakin' McDonald's right next door!  If you follow my reviews, you will know that *unfortunately, for my body* I love Mickey D's!  So the first time I saw the McDonald's and this Burger King side by side, I was shocked because I had never seen the two fast food giants in such close proximity to each other!

Anyway, my friend and I had enjoyed a DELICIOUS early dinner at Antico Pizza one Saturday afternoon and were in need of some coffee before our drive back home up north.  So we walked across the street to the Burger King.  I usually get my iced coffee from McDonald's, but for whatever reason, we decided to go to BK this time.

When I walked in, I was impressed with the interior design of this BK!  It looks like it must have been renovated fairly recently.  There were comfy-looking, cushiony seats at some of the tables, which actually turned out to be pretty comfy!  And the best thing I noticed about this particular BK is that they have not one but TWO Coke Freestyle machines!  I thought that was pretty awesome.

However, there were only two other customers in this BK while there were way more right next door.  Hmmm...  Not good...

My friend ordered a regular coffee and I decided to try their Iced Seattle's Best Vanilla Coffee.  At only $1.49 for a small iced coffee, it was reasonably priced.  However, it was probably the worst vanilla iced coffee I had ever had in my life.  I told my friend that it was way too sweet (too much syrup!) and literally tasted like melted coffee ice cream.  Gross...  =P  But I needed the caffeine and had already walked out before I had really had a chance to taste it, so I sucked it up (literally!) and just drank it.  Never again...

Overall, based on my one visit (since I probably won't return), this Burger King gets 2.5 stars rounded up to 3 stars.  It's ""OK"" because I like the layout and design as well as the Coke Freestyle machines, but I must repeat that the iced coffee was terrible.  The employees seemed friendly enough, and we got our coffees quickly since we were the only other customers besides the two who were already there.  Check out this BK if you happen to be craving Whoppers while passing through the area, but I would go to the McDonald's next door if you can't decided between the two.

33,11,1,1,2,1,"Having worked at a Burger King for a few years as my first job, l was always interested in seeing how other BK Lounges operated. This Burger King is by far the worst I've seen.

We came in for dinner wanting to try the Impossible Whopper which was about $8. I asked for it 'off the broiler' meaning the patty would be cooked fresh but of course it wasn't. The kitchen layout is also weird because you can actually see the broiler 5ft from the POS, meaning that you can see a worker put the frozen patties in the broiler. I mean, we all know it's fast food but I just found this off. The workers were also loud as you can hear them bickering with their miscommunications.

Anyways, the dining area was sticky and had trouble deciding which table to sit at because it seemed like a few hours since any table had been cleaned. We got our food pretty quickly and everything was already cold--whoppers, chicken fries and fries. The Impossible patty tasted bland and definitely not as good as a Beyond Meat burger. The water from the vending machine was also discolored from the other sodas I'm assuming. As we left, we pushed the door out but then this guy was also coming in. Instead of having the decency of opening the door for us and letting us go, he pushed his way in. The quality of people here this place surely attracts.

I really had no expectations coming in and I knew it wasn't going to be great or anything. The restaurant looks like it needs a serious upgrade.

We ordered in drive through, and the worker was short and impolite. When we got to the window to get items, we had ordered coffee with creamer and sugar. She handed us the coffe and walked aWay.  I asked through the window if we could gett the sugar and creamer so  we could put it in our coffee when waiting for the rest of the order. She rudely pointed to a bag she was holding and threw her hands up into thE air in irritation and said ""I'm getting it are you kidding me"" she did this three times in a row each time more  exaggerated thEn the last.

40,18,1,0,2,0,"It's actually comical how bad this Burger King really is. It's so terrible I actually want to bring people over there just to experience the wonderful terribleness. I give them the one star for location and having a large parking lot, but it's all downhill from there. The last three times that I've been there, I actually left without receiving any food! 

The first time I pulled up to the drive-through, waited at the speaker for a few minutes, and when no one came to take my order I figured it was broken. I pulled my car up to the drive-through window, looked inside and saw people making food, and they looked at me and just went back to what they were doing. I waited there a few minutes and then left. 

I chalked the first experience up to them being busy, so I went back a second time. This time they actually took my order, but when I pulled around to the window, no one showed up to take my money or give me my food. It was the strangest thing. I waited for over five minutes, give a couple of beeps on my horn, the people inside once again looked at me but never once opened the drive-through window. After sitting there for over seven minutes without once even being acknowledged, I just drove off.

The third time I went there I thought there was no way in heck that anything like my first two experiences would happen again. It had been over a month since I had been there, so I thought I would give it a shot. Again, this is in a convenient location, so I wanted it to work. This Time when I pulled up to the drive-through someone mumbled something over the speaker, I said ""I'm sorry what was that"", again someone mumbled something incoherent into the speaker, which I replied ""I'm sorry, I'm having a hard time hearing you, should I pull around?"" The person began yelling through the speaker angrily, like I had insulted her mom! It was insane! I couldn't help but laugh, which didn't help this persons disposition. After taking a comical amount of yelling I pulled around, waved and smiled, and drove off.

  Every single time I stop in here I find myself wondering why I hate myself so much that I would go through this ordeal. Every. Time. Even after they shut down for months and, err, remodeled the place (sure doesn't look like they updated anything) the service is lethargic at best, and the same manager lady is always handling both the counter and drive-thru window and a handful of other duties too.

The dining room is usually dirty, the place has a really run-down feel (decor from the 90's, it seems, but probably newer than that). The exterior and parking lot have a dirty feeling, it's hard to put your finger on it.  
  There were no window ads or promotions last time I went by, so it's hard to tell what's new at BK this month without going inside to find...ah forget it don't waste your time go anywhere else. Find a little burger, or burgerville, respect yourself and go get a salad somewhere.

42,20,1,0,0,0,"I have never before wished there was a zero star option. But now we are here. Genuinely one of the worst, if not the worst customer service experience I have ever had.

My wife, daughter, and I stopped in because daughter wanted Burger King and this was the closest one.

We politely waited our turn, at which point in time the woman at the register huffed at us, 'next' with zero eye contact and as if it were the biggest inconvenience in her life. I was immediately taken aback, but thought maybe I misread the situation and gave her the benefit of the doubt. Then I went to use the restroom (one of the dirtiest restrooms I have seen) and when I got back my wife is still trying to explain to the woman of what her order consisted. The woman argued with my wife, huffed, and generally acted completely put out. She told my wife my wife said something she did not say. My wife was being remarkably patient but that was enough; we both corrected her and told her that was not, in fact, what my wife said. She rolled her eyes again and continued being completely rude. When my wife asked for her name, she ignored my wife, said 'I'll just give you the food,"" and walked away.

After taking a remarkably long time actually getting the food, we were making our way out when we overheard her say to another customer, ""yeah, they just couldn't get their order right.""

It is interesting, because of the two people who are part of the equation, between the woman and my wife, I know who would know whether the order was 'right'. 

My wife remained remarkably calm throughout (I was actually surprised - she handled it way better than I would have).

Perhaps the woman *was* having a bad day, but as one of my best friends, Charles would say, ""That's not my problem.""

Angry customers who were stuck in the back on the line (where you're not blocked in) started parking and going in to see what was happening, but still nothing happened! Employees were going in and out of the building for their shifts ending and beginning, so it's not like they were oblivious to the 15 car line blocking the whole parking lot.

112,13,1,0,0,0,"I've never been to such a huge dumpster fire of a fast food restaurant before in my life.

I sometimes go to fast food places because my dogs love nuggets. Yes I know I'm both a pushover and a bad dog father, but goddamnit they love their nuggies. So I indulge them once a week. I figured why not get a couple of my favorite childhood sandwiches as well?

I had actually been thinking about original chicken sandwiches lately. It's been a while, and I used to love them. Crispy, zesty, elongated, chicken sandwiches. Simple. Delicious.

When I got to the drive through, it took a bit for someone to speak. I don't know if you are supposed to speak first these days, so maybe that's my fault.

I stated that I wanted two original chicken sandwiches and the attendant said ""ok so 2 spicy crispy chicken sandwiches"" and I replied that what she responded was mistaken and that I wanted two plain regular ORIGINAL chicken sandwiches, to which she replied ""ok so two crispy chicken sandwiches"" to which I, a third time, said original chicken sandwich. I said we might be getting it mixed up and asked if there was a difference between crispy chicken, and original chicken, because they appear to be different items on the menu. They were. She then responded ""oh ok so you want three original chicken sandwiches.""

...just the two will be fine...

So after that she asks if I want anything else. More like she says ""...anythingelseforyou?"" So I ordered a side of fries and some mozzarella sticks. 

""2 chicken sandwiches and a fries. Anything else?""

""Yes the mozzarella sticks as well please, and two orders of chicken nuggets""

""...thatallforyou?""

I pull up, pay, make sure the items are correct on my receipt, good to go. I get the bag and drive off. I'm snacking on my fries on the way home, and realize the load is a bit small, so I pull over and inspect my bag, and notice no nuggets. UGH! So I head back.

I retrieve my nuggets, which came with a bonus taco, and finally make it home. 

I soothe my beasts with their nuggies, put away more for tomorrow, and sit down to eat my chicken sandwiches. I have been waiting for this moment. 

I open the wrapper, and...mold. There's mold on this bread. I'm in the restaurant industry, shit happens, so I go to tear off the bit with the mold, and upon touching it I realize it's all stale. My fingers graze the sides of the chicken patty, and it's soggy. I open the bun...and the lettuce is rotten.

Like...at this point...I have thoroughly died inside. How....like why the fuck....

Ok so if I were working there, and had fucked up interpreting this guys order three goddamn times, I'd want to make DAMN sure the rest of his order was right or at LEAST in the damn bags. You better BELIEVE I'm getting back into that line making sure those sandwiches are goddamn flawless, and you better fucking believe I'm in front of that monitor making sure EVERY GODDAMN ITEM makes it into the bag. Even if it was just to save my own integrity.

I am highly upset. This location needs help. I just got off work, and wanted to get something to eat for my family. I have eaten at Burger King for years. This was my first time eating at this location. The screen that you order on is hanging you cant even verify if, its correct or not. 
Now on to my food. I ordered the special 2 original chicken sandwiches both with fries, with chz, pickle. Also ordered a couple orders of the chicken nuggets, and 2 orders of chz sticks. The lady at the window ask my family, and I to wait at the first window because the timer will be going to long at the window where you pick up the food. She said your food is going to be fresh ,and hot. My food was all but that. The sandwiches were microwaved, they were hard, not juicy at all. The chz was old, and the mayo was nasty as hell. The chicken nuggets were cold, the chz sticks were microwaved as well, when you cook chz it melts, and there is grease that comes from the chz sticks. No grease anywhere not even the sandwiches, not even the fries. I spent my hard a** earned money on nothing but junk. I threw that crap away, and cooked my family breakfast, although I was tired. At least it was fresh, and made with love. And not given to me like my money isn't important, and also under temperature just waiting to give me a virus, or better yet food poisoning.

Time to kill :
I decided to come here for a quick lunch and as I entered the establishment, I heard yelling.  As I took my place in line, I can't help but noticed that one of the, what it seemed to me is either an asst. manager or manager, yelling to a customer she's serving.  She's yelling (or if some may prefer, speaking VERY loudly), ""I don't speak Chinese!"" to the elderly couple, repeatedly.  Repeatedly.  Granted they're elderly.  It is possible that they might have a hard time hearing.  But most importantly, they probably don't speak English that well, or at all.  So, yelling out ""I don't speak Chinese!"" repeatedly is not going to help.  And yelling to a customer, is a huge no no.

It's simple.  Instead, of yelling, all she had to do was look for someone that can help translate.  If I knew Chinese, I would've dealt with it.  Luckily, one of the other patrons was nice enough to come over and offer his help to translate and solve the issue.  I'm very disappointed on how the staff handled this.  Imagine if these were your grandparents.

This location is the biggest in town and possesses the contemporary theme ever since it opened it's doors.  A separate seating area which use to be a children's play area with video games has since been converted to strictly a dining area to hold a larger seating capacity.  In the dining area there are 3 separate LCD TVs you can tune in while waiting for or enjoying your meal.  Washrooms are clean and looked after periodically.  Staff are generally nice and knowledgeable, but sometimes you have to remind them twice if you want ""Add Ons"" or specifics like extra mayo on your burgers.

Maybe the kids don't know any better.  The rest of the interior is nice and clean.

Staff were nice and quick with my order.

The chicken sandwiches (2 for $5 right now) really aren't anything special.  The meat is much too salty, and the only toppings are lettuce and mayo.  I had one of each (regular and spicy), and spicy just had an extra squirt of hot sauce.  The sandwiches are honestly quite sad looking.  See photo.

I've been through the drive-thru a couple of times but I've never actually gone into the establishment. It's not exactly the most welcoming Burger King I've ever been to. Every time I decide to get food there, something different happens. The food takes forever, there's a homeless person walking up to your windows while you wait, they make your food wrong and you gotta wait even longer, etc. I try to be a patient person and this Burger King is a true test to how hard I've been working on that virtue, no lie!

The reason I still give this fast food legend two stars instead of one is because of two things. First, Burger King is the only fast food joint that's open late and offers a veggie burger. If I'm being really honest, the only reason I go to any Burger King at all is because of the veggie burger option. Secondly, each time I get my food (and it's right or was fixed) my food is actually hot and good. No one likes a sloppy sandwich with too much or too little toppings and/or condiments. So that I'm thankful for. 

So yes! I'll continue to swing through this Burger King.

Noting other the reviews here it is true that the McDonalds across the street is always lined out in the double lane drive thru but there is never a queue for Burger King's drive thru.  Which mind you they usually take 15 minutes per car to actually distribute a customer's order anyways.

The main issue with this location is the absolute lack of respect for other people and lack of professionalism.  I caught on to their little game where if they don't want to make something they just say ""we don't have X"".  To test my theory I went and ordered a ""Brownie Sunday"" was told ""we don't have milkshake mix to make it"".  I come back 1 hour later and behold they have the milkshake mix.  This was at 9:00PM.  This location also has a tendency to backtalk their patrons, probably a first and the only location I ever experienced this.  They also yell at each other (using unprofessional language including racial terms that were audible to the dining room) behind the counter while there were customers in the dining room and that alone should have been not to visit the location again.

Finally the employees here are poorly trained.  Over a 3 month period I order  the same meal with a coupon 3 times.  In the 3 times I order the exact same meal I was charged 3 different ways and received the order 3 different ways, basically they never got the order right.  The meal in question was Whopper Value meal only Mustard, Ketchup and Cheese with a Coke.  I would say that shouldn't be hard to mess up but they were 0-3 in getting the order correct.  The times were weekday dining, weekend late night (about 10) and weekend lunch (about noon) so you can't blame the night shift on this.

I wish I can express these concerns to Burger King directly but the only thing I can see is some automated system so knowing how corporate america goes it probably will be shifted somewhere and never read.

I got the Steakhouse burger (I think it's called.)  Big, meaty, kinda expensive.  The picture was enticing.  The burger itself didn't quite live up to that, of course.  Held together well, surprisingly.  Looked decent.  And tasted: good enough.  The bun was dry, almost stale.  The burger was overcooked and dry.  But those, plus bacon, plus cheese, combined into a tasty enough burger.  

I got cheese sticks, and they were better than any fast food ones I've had, and equal to or better than some chain sit-down restaurants.  Not amazing, but good for what they are.

I like McDonald's fries better, but these are fine.  I also got a cherry slush, which was tasty enough and refreshing.
