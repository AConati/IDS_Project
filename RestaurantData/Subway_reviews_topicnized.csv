0,0,1,4,1,1,"Is there an option for no stars?

I am a university student (obviously) and I eat here quite often. I commute 1.5 hours and sometimes I forget to pack a lunch -- so Subway is always the best bet. Sometimes I get the footlong and eat half for lunch and the other half for dinner. It's actually quite perfect.

The reason why I wouldn't even give this place any stars is because of the customer service. Wow. I've had never been to a place with such terrible service. I mean, I'm not expecting full-fledged, strenuous service or anything, but I mean, can I get at least a smile!?

I would order my sandwich, and they would already be choosing my bread for me. I once asked for turkey and she scooped up tuna and smeared it on my bread (I wasn't paying attention because the other ladies were being terribly rude to a customer ahead of me and I couldn't help but watch in disgust). I corrected her and she looked at me, scoffed, rolled her eyes and tossed the tuna sandwich in the trash like it was bacteria infested. SO dramatic. Another occasion, I ordered a ham sandwich and I wanted it toasted -- but after her putting the ham, the cheese, she added lettuce without my saying. I told her I wanted it toasted and she said, ""too late."" I have umpteen many affairs with them, but the general point is the service is terrible. They are slow, rude and do NOT listen. It's awfully frustrating when the Subway is known for their ""personalized sandwiches"" and you get the complete opposite.

And they don't close the sandwich when they're done with it, instead, they just wrap it up. You know what that means, right? The sauce of your choice isn't in the sandwich, it's in the paper.

2,2,3,0,0,0,"I'm writing this because I think people need to cut them some slack. I have been at UBC since 2013 and don't live on campus, so sometimes I have to bend my dietary rules and eat fast food, and it normally is subway (if not at agora, sprouts etc.). Nearly every time I've gone there I have gotten the regular amount of vegetables and when I request extra,  I get extra without an issue. Only time I had an issue is when they cooked my veggie patty so it was burned on the outside and frozen on the inside (which isn't good, but mistakes happen).

I do agree, during peak hours they do rush you and have several sandwiches on the go. They have always ask you which one is yours before wrapping it up and sending you on your way if they aren't certain it's correct. In reality, most people would be complaining if the opposite were true considering the long line - ups.  I think people are perceiving them as ""rushing"" us or being rude and inconsiderate, when in rarity I believe they're trying to be efficient and respectful of students tight schedules.

There are two particular women who can come across rude and don't listen well, but they will always fix their wrongs (not their attitude though), not just pass along your sandwich and ignore you as I have read. The rest of them are so nice and actually try to get to know you when it isn't so busy! Those always the rotten apples of the bunch. I've also noticed they just hired a bunch of students who are doing a great job.

That said, management of Pacific Spirit food court needs to monitor their staff better (maybe those 2 rude ladies are the ones causing all of this hatred toward Subway) because there are so many rude staff generally in that food court. Also their hours of operation online  are so incorrect and misleading.

Given those factors, it should be pretty easy to please me. All I want is a Veggie Delite on whole wheat with extra cheese and A LOT of cucumber. That's not difficult, but this location PERPETUALLY skimps on toppings on the veggie sub,  which is infuriating considering the fact that it costs the same as a Meatball or Tuna sandwich. Look, I feel that if I'm paying the same amount as I would for meat, I should get an equivalent amount of vegetables to compensate. Most Subways are pretty cool with it when I'm like ""Load that sub with Cucumber friend"", they'll straight hook a dude up with a mound of greens or whatever. Not the Subway in the Student Union Building though, I don't know if the manager there is some kind of food cost fascist or what but every time I've ever asked to be topped up with toppings I get a blank stare before they pass my sandwich to the cashier.

9,2,1,1,1,0,"To be honest, I don't even know where to begin. This is the absolute worst Subway I've ever been to in my entire life... and I eat a LOT of Subway. I really, really wish I could give this place negative 5 stars because it's that bad. I don't even think I can even think of any other non-Subway restaurant or fast food joint with service this bad. It's THAT bad, and I don't know how the employees there have been working for so long, or why that Subway is still open. 

First things first, the UBC Student Union Building (SUB) isn't necessarily an oasis of food selection. You can get sushi, pizza, coffee, pastries, burgers, Chinese food, and some other basic food-court fare. There are also a few hidden gems in this building but they usually close earlier, so Subway is usually one of the only options when you're stuck in the centre of campus in the evening. 

I've ordered from this specific Subway location maybe about 4 or 5 times during my time here at UBC, but try and avoid it as much as I can. As a lover of Subway sandwiches, this place is truly a sorry excuse. None of my experiences here have ever been positive, and I decided to finally write this review after having a horrendous experience there today, when I had no choice but to eat there. This was my final time of ever ordering from this location. I've had enough of wasting my money here only to leave pissed off.

There were about 5 employees working. There were 2 customers in front of me and a few behind me, waiting in line. The employees did not acknowledge the customers before me (who were standing patiently) for a good 2 minutes. The moment they started both their sandwiches, they decided to start sandwiches for 5 people, including myself. They always seem to be making as many sandwiches as possible at once, which basically messes with everyone's orders.

I ordered a footlong steak & cheese. I LOVE my steak & cheese sandwiches and always make sure to load them up with every vegetable to the fullest. Whenever I order this sandwich from any other Subway, the ""artist"" could barely close it because of how much veggies are loaded into it. Yum! As a broke student, I want my money's worth.

Anyways, the lady who took my order and pulled the bread out barked at me for no apparent reason. Second lady who put the cheese on, threw the cheese onto my sandwich as if it was diseased or something, threw it in the toaster, and toasted it for too long. If you frequent Subway as much as I do, you notice that they practically scramble to get the sandwich out of the toaster as soon as it beeps. Well, they left it in for a little bit and all the sandwiches in there ended up looking quite crisp (not a good thing).

Now with the veggies, like I mentioned, I load them up to the fullest (but I only ask for extra when it comes to pickles and olives). Well, I got half a handful of lettuce, four misshapen tomato slices (2 of them being the ""butts"" of the tomato), 6 slices of olives (which makes up about an olive and a half) when I asked for extra, and a pinch of everything else. For reference, I get Subway quite often, and having a standard amount of veggies should make the sandwich hard to close. 

At that point, I was pretty damn disappointed, especially since I ordered one of the most expensive sandwiches. I get to the till, and the head grouchy lady barks the price to me. There were two sandwiches on the counter, one of them being the pizza sub of the guy behind me. His sandwich was ready to be rung through as well, so after I was told the price, I asked the cashier lady ""for the steak and cheese, right?"" just so the price is correct. She said yes in an awful tone and I paid. I grabbed my sandwich, and asked her ""steak and cheese?"" to make sure I was taking the right sub. She grouchily muttered ""YES"". Ok lady, calm down. 

I picked the sub up and I couldn't believe how light it was. Granted, the subs I'd get from this location were always feather-light because of how much they skimp out on the ingredients, so although I was disappointed, I sort of expected it.

I basically grabbed Subway for the purpose of having non-smelly, non-leaky, easily transportable, convenient food, especially since I was heading to a class. So I got what I wanted... or did I? I got to class, opened up my sandwich, and was quite annoyed as to how flat and pathetic it looked. I then open it up and it was a PIZZA SUB!!! The pizza sub of the guy that was standing behind me at Subway! At this point, I was fuming, but I couldn't go back. I ate the pizza sub in anger and dismay. Sigh.

So all in all... AVOID THIS SUBWAY LIKE THE PLAGUE!!! RUN! There is a new Subway in the UBC Village, about a 5 minute walk from the SUB. Do yourselves a favour and GO THERE! The difference in service and quality of food is ASTOUNDING. They actually smile and make your sandwich with care, even with all the crazy line-ups!

For me, when it comes to subway its all about freshness. How soft and fresh is your bread? Are your spinach leaves nice green and lush, lol? It's also about having all items in stock-- if I come to you near close will you still have m chocolate chip cookies, soft and gewy ready to go? And for the most part this location scores high.

43,0,2,2,0,0,"I've worked as a food server (and even as the assistant manager of a Subway) for most of my adult life so I generally try to avoid leaving bad Yelp reviews just because I personally know how bad they suck. That being said, my husband's and my experience tonight at the 164th location was definitely noteworthy. 

We pulled up to the drive-thru machine at about 8:15 tonight. I ordered a 6"" tuna on wheat with extra lettuce, onions, pickles, light mayo, vinegar, salt, pepper, and oregano. My husband ordered a 12"" chicken bacon ranch with spinach, bell pepper, banana pepper, jalapeños, chipotle, ranch, and the same seasonings as my sandwich. He accidentally selected diet soda rather than Dr Pepper and we figured he could ask to switch at the window.

When the sandwich artist (Jeanette) came to the back she went straight to the soda machine. The window was slightly cracked so my husband tried to get her attention before she poured the diet. I'm not sure how loud it is back there, so we assumed when she didn't respond that she just couldn't hear, even with the window open. She handed us our food and seemed less than interested in being there and it was at this point that my husband commented that she may have just ignored him when he tried to catch her attention.

It was when we got home that we noticed the real problems. My sandwich had maybe twelve strands of shredded lettuce in total, no seasonings, and definitely no vinegar aside from the few pickles it had.
