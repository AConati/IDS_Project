However, apparently the owners or CEOs were visiting that day and the kitchen seemed chaotic. Also when I first walk in I was the only one in the dinning room. Great! A chance to eat and read in peace. Then the place became crowded with really chatty regulars, which served to distract the staff even further. 

My 2 out of 3 of my burgers had their buns crooked, which seems odd for a food that is so uniformly served. They also seemed dry, as in lacking of grease. I'm at White Castle. I want a little grease to help this burgers slide down my throat.  The onion chips tasted watery, like biting into a mouthful of washed onion instead of crispy fried goodness.

I had to ask for a cup for my meal and then sauce because the counter service person just had to keep paying attention to the chatty regular. I felt like I had to interrupt their conversation just to get my food. OK I'm not a regular. I don't talk off your ear about how I've been eating White Castles for 50 years or how I cry every time the OSU Buckeyes lose a football game.

I know better too since this isn't my first time to have White Castle. About 10 years ago when I was in Ohio, I was told that they had the best sliders.  I tried it and was extremely disappointed. Fast forward to now and I got the same experience.  Service is great, but the sliders are just junk.  First of all, very little meat. Second, no taste except the overpowering pickle.  Third, soggy like it was cooked in the microwave. Lastly, really not fresh.

Over in the West Coast, people talk about how they miss White Castle. I'm still trying to figure out what they miss. If it's the great service, then I get it. If it's the price, yes it's cheap.  I'm just confused. White Castle's sliders are missing a lot, including taste.

PS:  At least these are cheap, only $.69 a slider.

21,2,2,21,20,15,"On December 30, 2014, something monumental happened in the world of food.  Yeah, you guessed it - White Castle rolled out their Veggie Burger and Mike ""Irish Green"" G. was there to try their three newest sandwiches.

For 99 cents you get a Dr. Praeger brand veggie burger with your choice of honey mustard, ranch, or sweet Thai sauce.  It's vegetarian but not vegan - the patty is, the bun isn't according to the White Castle employee I spoke to.  The burger itself is made from lots of vegetables like carrots, spinach, zucchini, peas, and broccoli.  I tried one of each.

My take on these new burgers?

* The Sweet Thai was really pretty gross, two bites and into the trash with that one.

* The Ranch version was better, slightly better.  I ate half - the rest went into the trash.

* The Honey Mustard one was decent and the only slider that I finished.

So what's the problem here?

* The patty themselves have little flavor.

* They need some more flavorful sauces like A1, Teriyaki, Spicy Mustard, or a BBQ sauce.  Hell maybe even some Franks Red Hot would perk these things up.

* The weren't steamed on a bed of onions like their signature burgers to give them that wonderful White Castle taste we love at 2:27 am.

* The veggie burgers don't get a pickle and I like the pickle.

So all in all, they aren't that good but if they used a smaller, thinner patty, steamed them with onion and added a pickle...I'd be all over that in a heartbeat.

There's always a swerving of obstacles in the lot and drive thru lane. Mostly garbage, but you never know, and don't want to chance running over it. Example would be the car I saw run over a pretty full warm chocolate shake, that splattered onto his car. 

Customer service is always lackluster. You know the attitude I speak of. From the payment window, where they look at you like it's beneath them to hand you 2 cents change. The pick up window, where they are so quick to close it before you find what you may have been shorted.

The food is NEVER like what you see in a picture. Sandwiches slid into boxes, are often disassembled upon entry. It's usually fast because it's been cooked, waiting for you to order it. Try to order something irregular for fresh hot choices. My recent venture for a try at the breakfast menu did not disappoint my expectations. However I was pleased with the amount of bacon, and the fully cooked quality. Getting it on the toast was as I expected. slightly warm bread. I guess I need to request double toasted. The contents were all in one corner, as if it should have been on a slider bun.

Listen WC is not my go to. They truly got it right when they slogan'd it ""What you Crave"". I do not visit until it is what I crave. Breakfast was ordinary, and for $2 sandwich, I can keep it on my lazy list with no great expectations.

After last call, I told the group we were drinking with that I'd never partaken of the famous burger joint even though I loved the movie.

My sister ordered for herself and added on one burger for moi.  A measly 61 cents?  Why so cheap?

I'll tell you why.  Because it tastes like shit.  Like limp, moldy steamed shit. 

I had two bites - TWO - and refused to eat the rest.

One of the guys in the group chuckled and asked me, ""Ever had Moctezuma's Revenge?""  And when I told him not for decades his chuckle turned into a cackle when he said, ""White Castle is even worse.""

I scoffed.  I mean, two bites...please.

Then, after an hour, those two bites proved more effective than a box full of ExLax.  

But hey, I'm a trooper.  I went to bed confident that the bout had passed and I'd be fine. 

However, White Castle was not through with me yet.  After sleeping for hours, before even eating a bite, I started having another attack of the bubble guts.  

I asked my cousin if it was possible that those two fateful bites could be the culprit.  
""Wait, you actually went to White Castle?  Shit, Libby.  I thought you were joking.  Everyone knows that that place is a guaranteed pain in the ass....literally.""

118,0,5,1,0,1,"This is not the White Castle of my youth that I remember! Growing up in the Detroit area, these ""slider"" joints were aplenty with the greasy late night food you'd expect. I don't remember what the inside looked like because it's been that long since I've been in one.

If the Short North location is any indication, I'd say that White Castle has overhauled their menu, their environment, and their concept altogether. Yes, you can still find the sliders you may remember. I saw French fries and other items you'd expect at a fast food joint. However, lots felt very different.

As we walked in around 11pm on a weeknight, we were greeted by a very friendly cashier who was glad to tell us about our menu options and to answer any questions we had. The space was very clean and inviting. It was very lit-up like you'd expect out of a fast food place, but the White Castle swag for sale, the heated pick-up order lockboxes, and the swanky menu made this one different from what I remember.

The front window had a row of seats, sort of like most sandwich shops and coffee shops, complete with outlets for your laptops and other devices. The booths and other tables were neat and clean, moreso than your average fast food place.

As a vegetarian, I was most impressed with my menu options. They serve the ""Impossible"" burger, which is an idea that came to life in the past few years from a newer company- a burger that is not made from animal product, but allegedly tastes like it is... So I'll pass for now. Maybe it's something a carnivore would enjoy without the guilt of eating an animal?

However, they also have two separate other veggie burger options, including one that is a black bean veggie burger. Impressive! This officially makes White Castle the most progressive fast food company in the Midwest! We weren't terribly hungry, we had only come in out of curiosity, so we tried one of each of these. They cost only 99 cents, but they are small. I remember in my youth having friends and family members who could put away 5-10 sliders easily at White Castle. I wasn't up for that task on this night. Instead, my wife and I split one of each, just to taste. If I had gone for dinner, I could see eating about 3 of them with a side of fries and being nicely full.

They were surprisingly delicious, the taste matching that of other chain restaurant veggie burgers. For this price, the convenience, the speed of service, I would like to go here again! I don't know about their meat options, but for a vegetarian, this could be a fun return to fast food burgers.

I don't know if all White Castles are going this way, or if the Short North just has the most upscale White Castle in all of the land, but I think the company should use this as a model for other trendy neighborhoods. If they do, I could see them doing well there, once people catch on that it's no longer your traditional old-style ""slider"" joint anymore.

125,7,4,3,3,3,"This White Castle location seems incredibly out of place. My fast food companion speculated that it was probably here long before the surroundings were gentrified to become what is now Short North, Columbus' hip new downtown district.

We literally walked across the street from Mouton, the impressively cool whiskey and craft cocktail bar serving pricey cocktails. The experience felt like a tale of two Ohios: big-city hipster joint vs. classic midwest fare.

But somehow these two opposite ends still offered that polite, midwest charm. We received excellent service at White Castle from a surprisingly friendly and helpful cashier. She even checked in with us when we got accosted by a vagrant who wanted to engage in a conversation about random topics including whether we were ""Asian or Chinese."" Unfortunately it seems, that vagrant (and possibly others) seems to wander in quite a bit, so this location seems to be the place where you should get your order to go, or make it a quick meal.

The food came up very hot. We each enjoyed four sliders each, and I had a fish slider, two regular hamburgers, and a cheese(burger) slider. The meat, which is so processed it seems pork based rather than beef as the packaging states, is so thin that I was surprised that I didn't like the cheeseburger b/c the cheese slice dominated over the flavor of the tiny piece of meat. I enjoyed the regular burgers better as you could focus on tasting the meat and the greasy dehydrated onion bits. As the quality is lessor than McDonald's, I really am only at a White Castle for the pop culture, kitsch experience.

It was nice that I got two sliders for free, as my receipt printed out a survey code and did the phone survey right inside the restaurant, taking the sliders to go after our meal.

148,3,4,3,2,2,"You either eat 'em and smile or you grimace.  Those are the hard facts about White Castle ""sliders"" and all the other fine little morsels of indespensible fast foodies served up.

Have I ever walked into a Whitey Cassels and ordered.  Oh, maybe once back in college days.  It's the drive-thru that captures all that is Blanco de Porcelain!  You've got sliders, sliders with cheese, death stix, carp on bun and a wider selection of goodies to choose from.... including clucks (chicken).  Double up on the steamed toe nails (onions) and an extra slice of yellow mucus (cheese) and at 2AM the car not only smells tasty... it will carry over to the next day and have vapors akin to an 8-day old unwashed foot.  Heaven, sheer heaven!  Crinkle cut death stix are terrific.

Truly, White Castle food is American royalty food.  This store on Kenny and Henderson has always bagged and pushed into your car window hot morsels of steaming funk.  This is key.  A slider that's luke warm will bring up the night's misgivings if you're not careful.
